;defines basic functions for mixing purposes
;note: the user shouldn't have to deal with mixing


;we could use the actual curves but we will do a simple adjustment to 
;have a more balanced mixed
define function freq-to-amplitude-adjustment(freq)
 begin
	with max-amplitude = .1 ;to avoid clipping
	return max-amplitude * (1 - ((freq - 20.0) / (20000.0 - 20.0)))
